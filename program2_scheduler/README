HOW TO RUN IT:


1. For what types of workloads does SRTN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
When all the jobs have the same execution time. 
2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRTN deliver the same response times as RR?
A quantom length that is large enough that can make all the jobs run to completion. 
3. What happens to response time with SRTN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend? 
The response time and jobs lengths have a correlation. If the jobs lengths increase so does the response time. 
Run: python ./scheduler.py -p testFiles/FCFS.tst had an average of 3.2 wait time. 
python ./scheduler.py -p testFiles/FCFS_LONG.tst had all execution times 3 times the amount of FCFC.tst, the wait time was 13.2 which was about 4 times the wait time of the previous test. 
python ./scheduler.py -p testFiles/FCFS_LONGLONG.tst which doubles the execution time of the previous and 6 times the first test. The average is 28.2 which is about double the previous one. Our assumptions are correct. 
4. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
Has a inverse correlation therefore if the quantom length increases, the shorter so does the response time. It will reach a point where the quantom > longest job in which would become FCFS. 
Equation: (N-1)Q / N (if all the jobs are the same execution length)
