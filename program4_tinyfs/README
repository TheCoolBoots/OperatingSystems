All the functions work as intended from our design document (from what we can see)

Additional Functionalities:
Rename and readdir - we wrote test cases for rename and readdir (they passed WAHOOOO)
Encyprtion - we created an encrpted disk, which is just NONSENSE, and we were able to read its content 
and write to it through our encyprtion key (Encyprtion is not in the Demo, see video please)

Limitations (NOT SAID IN VIDEO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME SO SORRY):
Superblock bitmap is only 1776 bits long, therefore max number of files is 1776
Each directory can only point to 236 * (256/16) files, this is the max directory size
Filenames can't contain '_'
Max number of encrypted files = 256/16 but can have encrypted and non-encrypted files on the same disk
Password hash is stored in plaintext
