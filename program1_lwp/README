How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library? Name two ways in which this LWP library API could be improved.

Firstly this thread management library is single-cored while others can take advantage of multiple cores. This library also doesn't have any synchronization tools for shared memory access. This library also doesn't have any external interrputs; thread A can't interrupt thread B it can only yield control back to the scheduler.

One way this library could be improved is tying up all the memory leaks; in exit() the malloc'ed stacks for each thread are never freed. Also the round robin scheduler doesn't have perfect round robin scheduling, it just passes control to the next thread. This means it's not necessarily sharing cpu time equally. If we were to implement some kind of timer to track how many cycles each thread runs for.
